Search for hidden treasure with your metal detector!

Explore the areas until your metal detector is beeping quickly over a certain spot. But be careful, the metal detector is pointing ahead, not to the spot you're standing on!

Be wary of the metal detector's positioning and your environment to Cache Out!

If you'd like to edit the project and add modifications yourself, download the "CachOutUnityDev" folder and add it to Unity version 2019.4.18f1 as a new project.
